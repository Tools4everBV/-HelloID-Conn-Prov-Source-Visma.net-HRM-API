The Visma.net Source Connector significantly automates the management of user accounts and access rights in Visma.net. By using this connector, you can link Visma.net to the Identity & Access Management (IAM) solution HelloID by Tools4ever. This integration saves time managing accounts and authorisations, and automates this error-prone process. This article provides more information about this link, its specific capabilities, and its benefits.

## What is Visma.net?

Visma.net is a fully integrated solution for Human Resource Management (HRM) and payroll processing. The solution is available online and allows various administrative tasks previously carried out by the HR department to be delegated to employees and managers themselves. They can manage recurring tasks without the intervention of the HR department, such as updating vacation records, recording absences, or modifying their personal details. This frees up the HR department to focus on other tasks that add more value, such as giving advice and developing policies.

## Why is a Visma.net integration useful?

Managing user accounts and access rights manually is not only time-consuming but also susceptible to errors. HR departments need to ensure that new employees have the necessary resources from day one to perform their roles effectively. Additionally, any changes in roles, locations, or employment status must be accurately reflected in all associated systems and applications. By integrating Visma.net with HelloID, these processes can be automated based on your HR system data, streamlining operations and reducing errors. The Visma.net connector facilitates connections with commonly used target systems such as:

*	Active Directory
*	Nedap Ons

More details about these integrations are provided later in this article.

## HelloID for Visma.net assists you with:

**Error-free account management:** When a new employee joins, it's essential to create the correct accounts and assign the required authorisations. The integration between Visma.net and HelloID simplifies this task, automating the process and ensuring error-free management of accounts, requiring no manual intervention. This boosts user satisfaction by ensuring employees have timely access to the resources they need.

**Quicker account creation:** Users can only be fully productive if they have access to the required accounts and systems. Whether it's onboarding a new employee or updating roles for current staff, you want to create all required accounts and grant authorisations as quickly as possible. The integration between Visma.net and HelloID streamlines and accelerates this process. HelloID automatically detects the creation of a new user in Visma.net, sets up the required accounts in your target systems based on the information in Visma.net, and assigns the appropriate permissions.

**Enhanced security:** Mistakes in managing accounts and authorisations can potentially aid attackers and unnecessarily expose your organisation to cyber threats. You want to give malicious actors as little opportunity as possible, in part by minimising the so-called attack surface. A crucial aspect of this is promptly deactivating accounts of departing employees and revoking unnecessary authorisations. The integration automates this process, thereby enhancing your digital security.

## How HelloID integrates with Visma.net

The integration with Visma.net ensures that HelloID has all the necessary source data to fully automate account provisioning and authorisation management. Visma.net serves as the source system for HelloID.

| Change in Visma.net |	Procedure in target systems |
| ------------------------| --------------------------| 
| New employee |	Based on data from Visma.net, HelloID creates a user account in connected applications, assigning the appropriate group memberships. Depending on the role of the new employee, the IAM solution also creates the required user accounts in other systems and assigns the correct permissions.
| Change in employee role |	A new role may require different authorisations. HelloID automatically modifies user accounts and, if necessary, assigns or revokes permissions in connected systems. The authorisation model of HelloID is always leading in these cases.
| Employee name change |	The display name and email address are modified if required.
| Employee leaves |	HelloID deactivates user accounts in target systems and notifies relevant employees in the organisation. Over time, the IAM solution automatically deletes the deactivated accounts.

HelloID uses the REST APIs of Visma.net to import a standard set of data into the HelloID Vault. This digital vault is where the IAM solution uniformly stores information by mapping data to the appropriate fields. This includes employee details, contract information, and company information.

## Customised data exchange

Although HelloID significantly automates the management of accounts and authorisations, you always remain in control. This also applies to the integration between Visma.net and your target systems. For instance, if you use custom fields in Visma.net, HelloID automatically loads these fields through the connector. In HelloID, you can then map these custom fields to the correct fields and use the data in the provisioning process.

## Integration Visma.net with target systems via HelloID

Through HelloID, you can connect Visma.net to various target systems. HelloID can automatically implement changes from Visma.net to your target systems, taking a significant workload off your shoulders, elevating the management of users and authorisations to a higher level. Some common integrations include:

**Visma.net - Active Directory Connection:** This connection automates manual tasks and prevents human errors. HelloID ensures automatic synchronisation between Visma.net and Active Directory, keeping accounts and access rights fully up to date.

**Visma.net - Nedap Ons:** This integration automates account provisioning and the management of authorisations in Nedap Ons. As a result, healthcare workers have the right access to client information in Nedap Ons from their first day of work.

HelloID supports over 200 connectors, allowing the IAM solution to interface with a broad spectrum of source and target systems. These extensive integration capabilities allow you to connect Visma.net to all popular target systems. You can find a list of all available connectors here.
